first, setup a virtual environment. go to your project directory using cd. using the following command
python -m venv venv
ur virtual setup will be complete.

then
source venv/bin/activate   (if linux/wsl)
or
venv\Scripts\activate     (if windows)

then
pip install -r requirements.txt


to setup npm, u already have package.json file.
all u need to do is cd to frontend folder then run
npm install
all dependencies needed will be installed from this in node setup and u will see node_modules folder created in frontend folder


although a database is already given, as we are still testing, we ahve to delete the whole database and create it again. to do that i have created a python file called insert_questions.py. 
this file creates the database as well as insert chapter and question data that we will be using. so u have to run it in the main project folder only.
